    about: "I am an AI & Machine Learning engineering student with a strong interest in learning and teaching. My journey in technology started early through hands-on experience with computers and continuous self-driven learning. This has helped me build a clear technical mindset and understand how systems work in real-world situations, not just in theory.\n\nI enjoy sharing knowledge and helping others learn and grow. I focus on improving my skills step by step, staying consistent, and building strong fundamentals. My goal is to use my technical knowledge and passion for education to contribute positively to a learning-focused environment while continuing to grow both personally and professionally.",
